# Introduction

This readme file provides information about the database used in a study that focused on analyzing ECG signals. The study aimed to investigate the performance of a particular algorithm in detecting abnormalities in ECG signals.

# Database Used

The ECG signal data used in this study were obtained from a public database called PhysioBank. Specifically, we downloaded four public databases of ECGs on normal, CAD, MI, and CHF as our experimental data. These databases are as follows:

1. MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database (NSRDB)[https://physionet.org/content/nsrdb/1.0.0/]
2. St. Petersburg INCART 12-lead Arrhythmia Database (INCARTDB)
3. PTB Diagnostic ECG Database (PTBDB)
4. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre (BIDMC) Congestive Heart Failure Database

The databases contain ECG signal map segments and specific information about the ECG recordings.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the study utilized a publicly available database called PhysioBank to investigate the performance of an algorithm in detecting abnormalities in ECG signals. The study used four public databases of ECGs on normal, CAD, MI, and CHF as experimental data, namely, MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database (NSRDB), St. Petersburg INCART 12-lead Arrhythmia Database (INCARTDB), PTB Diagnostic ECG Database (PTBDB), and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre (BIDMC) Congestive Heart Failure Database.
