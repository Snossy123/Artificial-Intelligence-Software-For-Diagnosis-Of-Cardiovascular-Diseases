# Introduction

This readme file provides information about the four databases of ECGs used in a study that focused on analyzing ECG signals. The study aimed to investigate the performance of a particular algorithm in detecting abnormalities in ECG signals.

# Databases Used

The study utilized four databases of ECGs with different diagnostic types, leads, sampling frequencies, number, duration of each case, and specific cases. The information for each database is listed below:

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the study utilized four databases of ECGs with different diagnostic types, leads, sampling frequencies, number, duration of each case, and specific cases. The databases used were MIT-BIH NSRDB, St. INCARTDB, PTBDB, and BIDMC CHFDB. The study aimed to investigate the performance of a particular algorithm in detecting abnormalities in ECG signals using these databases.
