This report provides an overview of functions to create and evaluate a deep learning model using cross-validation and test data. 

Data Preparation:

The data is originally provided as compressed CSV files, which are loaded into a list using the prepare_df() function. The data is then split into input X and output y, with the output classes encoded as integers. The get_dummies() function is used to convert the output classes into one-hot encoded vectors to prepare the data for the deep learning model. 

Model Architecture:

The model architecture includes convolutional layers followed by a transformer encoder. The convolutional layers are used to extract features from the input data, while the transformer encoder is used to model the temporal dependencies in the data. The transformer encoder includes multi-head attention and feedforward layers. This architecture is designed to effectively capture the patterns and temporal relationships in the data, which is essential for accurate predictions.

Training:

The model is trained using K-fold cross-validation, with the number of folds set to 10. The model is trained on nine folds and validated on one, with the validation accuracy used to evaluate the performance of the model. The best model is selected based on the highest validation accuracy and saved for future use.

Results:

The performance of the model is evaluated using the test data. The saved best model is loaded, and its weights are used to create a new instance of the model. The test data is loaded and prepared for testing. The model is then evaluated on the test data using the evaluate() function, which returns the loss and accuracy scores. The test accuracy score is printed for each fold, and the average test accuracy score is calculated and printed.

The validation and test accuracy scores for each fold are plotted using a line chart, with the validation accuracy represented by a line and the test accuracy represented by red dots. The confusion matrix is calculated and printed to provide an overview of the model's performance on each label. Various performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are calculated and printed using the classification_report() function. The performance metrics are calculated for each label and the overall score.

A heatmap of the confusion matrix for each label is created using the seaborn library. This visualization provides a better understanding of the model's performance on each label. The input and output for a single test case are printed, and the predicted output is calculated using the best model. The predicted output is mapped to the corresponding class label, and the predicted class label is printed to verify the model's accuracy.

Conclusion:

The code provides a comprehensive pipeline for creating and evaluating a deep learning model using cross-validation and test data. The model architecture includes convolutional layers and a transformer encoder, which can effectively capture the temporal dependencies in the data. The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics, and the results are presented using visualizations. The code can be used to evaluate the performance of the model on new test data, which is essential for accurate predictions.
